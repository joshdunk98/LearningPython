    "#### Formatting\n",
    "<span style=\"font-size:1.2em;\"> String formatting is an important part about string manipulation. For string formatting, you are manipulating the string as you print/store it. It is a dynamic way of creating a string compared to hard coding. Think of it as creating a string template. We use format specifiers (e.g. **%d**, **%f, etc.) to help specify the type of value that we want to place in the string. You can look up more about string formatting here: https://realpython.com/python-string-formatting/ .</span>"

    "<span style=\"font-size:1.2em;\"> Slicing is a way to obtain a specific character or substring in a string. Essentially, strings are similar to lists in Python (lists are covered in the next section). You can access a specific character or substring by indexing into the string. Indexing works by providing the name of the string variable and then using bracket notation to specify the position of the character or substring. Let's take a look at the following example. Let's try to get the character \"e\" from **word**.</span>"
