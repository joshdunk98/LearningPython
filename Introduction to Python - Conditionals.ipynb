    "<span style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">You probably remember how we talked about booleans back in the Data Types lesson. They're used to help express the truth in an expression (i.e., True or False). When we are using conditional statements, booleans operators are imperative. They're not the same as comparison operators (**\\<**, **\\>**, etc.). Boolean operators include the keywords **and** (&&), **or** (||), and **not**. Boolean operators are used as conjunctions to combine two or more expressions to create a more refined truth statement.</span>"
